# sales-dashboard
I recently imported a CSV file into Power BI and created a dynamic dashboard to visualize key metrics, including profit and sales forecasts. Here’s a quick overview of the process:
Data Import: Successfully loaded data from a CSV file.
Data Preparation: Utilized Power Query Editor for data cleansing and transformation.
DAX Functions: Created new columns to calculate crucial metrics like profit using DAX.
Visualizations:
Area Chart: For comparing performance over time.
Clustered Bar Chart: To analyze sales across different categories.
Donut Chart: To visualize profit distribution.
Line Chart: To showcase trends and include forecasting for future sales.
This project has enhanced my skills in data visualization and analytical thinking. I'm looking forward to using these insights to drive better decision-making!
If you have any tips or insights on Power BI, I’d love to hear them!
